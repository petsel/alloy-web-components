# _"Crafted Alloy"_ Web-Components Playground

## / _"The art of alloying"_ /

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/petsel/alloy-web-components)

Yet another custom-element web-component abstraction library.

And while its approach is focused on handing back the markup's control/ownership to a physical level, either purely hand written or e.g. server-generated, its initial footprint is featherlight due to **re-usable**, **configurable roles/traits** - either as **existing base behaviors** or as **custom written** ones.

The name _**"Crafted Alloy"**_ so far is the working name for this ongoing research-project.

There are already other ui-libraries, browser related or desktop only, which feature/play with either name like [_**Craft.js**_](https://craft.js.org/) which ... _"is a React framework for building powerful & feature-rich drag-n-drop page editors"_ ... or [_**Alloy**_](https://github.com/adobe/alloy) which ... _"is the web SDK for the Adobe Experience Platform"_. There is also [_**AlloyUI**_](https://alloyui.com/) built on top of [_**YUI3**_](https://github.com/yui/yui3) as well as the [_Alloy Concepts_](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Guide/Alloy_Concepts.html) of the [_**Titanium SDK**_](https://titaniumsdk.com/).

Nevertheless, since the _alloy_ metaphor works for this project's approach too, the project for now sticks with this initially chosen name. But the naming in future might become a moving target. Following names are possible ...

 - _**Crafted Alloy**_ => **`'ca-'`**
 - _**Custom Alloy**_ => **`'ca-'`**
 - _**Artificial Alloy**_ => **`'aa-'`**/**`'a2-'`**

 ... mainly because each pretty much says what the library is about but also for the sake of a handy to use library-name abbreviation which is needed as prefix for both, own event-names (important) and tag-names (less important) for the custom-element registry.
